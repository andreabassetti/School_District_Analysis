# School_District_Analysis

##Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this assignment is to help Maria run a technical analysis on math, reading, and overall scores for a series of schools. The analysis will help draw conclusions at the grade, school, school type, budget, and size level. In this assignment we have been informed of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade class of Thomas High School. Since we do not know the extent of the dishonestly we will simply be removing all data for that cohort to not skew the results 

##Results:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

##Summary:
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
